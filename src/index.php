                <h2>why</h2>
                <p>i archive and store as much data as i possibly can, and make as much use of that space as possible. but why?</p>
                <p>while many people will scroll through apps such as tiktok, and laugh at passing trends which fade into obscurity, i save each one which i believe may have cultrual significance.</p>
                <p>it's the small things that i remember and wish i had saved. thus, i aim to preserve our generation in media, whether it be the college/political ads of our time, or simple things such as tiktoks.</p>
